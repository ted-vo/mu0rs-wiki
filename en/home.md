# Mu0rs

Certainly, hardly any online gamers from the 80s, 90s, or even the 70s and 60s would be unfamiliar with MU Online. It has once dominated the gaming scene for a very long time, both domestically and internationally. During its golden age, MU Online almost monopolized the online gaming market, and you could find it in almost any gaming room.

Today, MU Online servers are sprouting up in abundance. New MU servers emerge daily, sometimes hourly. Finding the best MU, a stable MU, or one with a large player base is not at all simple. Every admin promises and paints a very enticing picture: the server will exist indefinitely, without a webshop, and admins won't sell items outside... but in reality, it's just a distant dream. And for a gamer to find a dedicated MU to play is even more challenging, not to mention exhausting.

Not to mention that nowadays, MU servers are mainly reset servers. While the era that brought back golden memories of MU was one with non-reset servers. The beauty of MU is gradually disappearing.

To revive the passion and intense childhood memories, Mu0rs (MU non reset) was founded with the hope of providing a playground for brothers and also a place to relax during tired moments.

Mu0rs.Com has been established for quite some time now. Initially, it was just members of the MU development team playing and learning from each other, having fun and chatting. By the end of 2012, the beginning of 2013, the MU server was officially opened under the domain munonreset.com. After discussing with members, at the end of 2013, munonreset.com officially became Clbmu.net, and by 2021, the team disbanded, and Tan changed the domain name to Mu0rs.Com as it is today.

From the establishment of the MU NON RESET server, the Administration Board has aimed for a non-bloodsucking server (almost like a free MU server), and it remains so until now.

You may wonder whether the server of Mu0rs is stable? Does the MU server have a webshop selling items? Does it cost money to play this MU? And the most important thing is whether the Admin sells items outside? ... You can ask the players themselves for the most accurate answers to this part.
